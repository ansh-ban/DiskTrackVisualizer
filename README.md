📊 TrackVisualizer
TrackVisualizer is a powerful and interactive web application that visualizes disk scheduling algorithms in action. It allows users to input disk I/O requests and see how different scheduling strategies affect the movement of the disk head and total seek time.

🔍 Features
🚀 Supports popular disk scheduling algorithms:

FCFS (First Come First Serve)

SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)

SCAN

C-SCAN

LOOK

C-LOOK

📈 Real-time visualization of the seek sequence

📉 Total seek time calculation for each algorithm

🧠 Comparison mode to find the most optimal algorithm

🌐 Clean and intuitive Flask-based web interface

🧩 Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for visualization and interaction)

Backend: Python (Flask)

Visualization Logic: Custom logic for head movement and seek time analysis

🚦 Use Case
Whether you're a student learning operating system concepts or a developer interested in disk I/O optimization, TrackVisualizer helps you understand and compare disk scheduling algorithms effectively.

📌 Getting Started
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/TrackVisualizer.git
cd TrackVisualizer
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser to get started.

💡 Why TrackVisualizer?
Disk scheduling algorithms can be tricky to understand from plain text or pseudo-code. TrackVisualizer brings them to life through animation and visual feedback, making complex OS concepts easier to grasp.
